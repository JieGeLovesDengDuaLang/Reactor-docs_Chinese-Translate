Installing Reactor is the second step in the [Overall Goals](/#overall-goals).
This is the Reactor.dll client side mod, not to be confused with any other part of the
Reactor framework.

## How to Install

- Download latest Reactor from [NuclearPowered/Reactor/releases](https://github.com/NuclearPowered/Reactor/releases).
- Copy the `Reactor.dll` file to your `BepInEx/plugins` folder.
  This folder is the one where we previously extracted BepInEx to, the Among Us directory.

## Test the current BepInEx modloader install

Now that we have a mod downloaded, launch BepInEx to make sure that everything is working.
You should see the **BepInEx version** and **Reactor version** in the top left, similar
to this picture:

If this does not appear, follow the instructions in [Install BepInEx](quick_start/install_bepinex.md)
again, and ask in our community [Discord Server](https://reactor.gg/discord) for help.
