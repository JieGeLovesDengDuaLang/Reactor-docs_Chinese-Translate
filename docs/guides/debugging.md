## Intro to debugging your mod
Before launching your mod, we highly recommend for you to turn on bepinex's console for Among Us.
Head on to the path to your Among Us install. From there, go into `BepInEx/config`.
You should see the file `BepInEx.cfg`. Open up the `BepInEx.cfg` file and find the header
`[Logging.Console]` and change `Enabled = false` to `Enabled = true`

## Reactor.Debugger
If you wish to start the game with less than 4 clients, you can use the `Reactor.Debugger`
Download [Reactor.Debugger.dll](https://nightly.link/NuclearPowered/Reactor/workflows/main/master/Reactor.Debugger.dll) and copy to your `BepInEx/plugins`
