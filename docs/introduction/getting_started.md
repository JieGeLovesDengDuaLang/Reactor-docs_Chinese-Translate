a modding environment. It contains a detailed explanation of how one would approach
modding the game Among Us. Finally, it walks through the process of getting your mod
installed and playing it.

## Prerequisite Information

1. Loading external mods requires **BepInEx**.
2. BepInEx provides an environment for mods to patch Among Us functions, to change how they run, as well as call Among Us and Unity methods.
3. A quirk of Among Us is that it is compiled using **il2cpp**. Which makes decompilation really annoying.
4. Luckily, the Reactor Framework automatically handles all the hard parts for you.

:::important

Mods for the game are programmed in **C#**. It is similar to other higher level languages
like Java. Though the programming concepts in this guide are simple to follow, prior
programming experience is heavily recommended.

## What are the different parts of the Reactor Framework?

- **Reactor Framework** is the all-encompassing umbrella term for many NuclearPowered
  projects. It may also be referred to as just Reactor in general language.
- **Reactor** (Reactor.dll) refers to the client side mod. It provides helper extensions
  and utility functions for other client mods.

## Overall Goals

4. Download and configure a C# IDE to work with the template.
5. Compile the project and obtain the mod file.
